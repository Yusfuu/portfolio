            With IT Domaine, I am highly motivated and have a strong passion for
            web development.
            <br />
            <br />
            I&apos;ve gained a lot of experience from youcode school internships
            and projects, and I&apos;m also a quick learner who isn&apos;t
            hesitant to try out new technologies as well as problem-solving
            abilities that are intuitive.
            <br />
            I&apos;ve worked with a lot of frameworks, Especially express in
            node js, React in JavaScript, and Laravel in PHP, for the versioning
            part I used Git, GitHub and for the testing part used jest.
            <br /> Youcode Projects Helped me a lot to strengthen my skills in
            Those Technologies, Team working, and team management as I was
            almost the lead in all of my groups.
