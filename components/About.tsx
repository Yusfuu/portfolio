            With IT Domaine, I am highly motivated and have a strong passion for
            web development.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've gained a lot of experience from youcode school internships and
            projects, and I'm also a quick learner who isn't hesitant to try out
            new technologies as well as problem-solving abilities that are
            intuitive.
            <br />
            I've worked with a lot of frameworks, Especially express in node js,
            React in JavaScript, and Laravel in PHP, for the versioning part I
            used Git, GitHub and for the testing part used jest.
            <br /> Youcode Projects Helped me a lot to strengthen my skills in
            Those Technologies, Team working, and team management as I was
            almost the lead in all of my groups.
